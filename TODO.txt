## scrapers
- UK Scraper from National Grid (hopefully an API)
- Quick scraper to download the German Household data from Bundesnetzagentur website
- incorporate Spanish scraper and extractor

## analysers
- monthly demand analyser (groupby - add Eurostat; add BNetzA)

## ad hoc
- CBS extractor - how do we need to use this for the Dutch data? can compare old CBS data with what I get now from ENTSOG
