# Ben
- preFeb2020 data not downloaded from UK National Grid (may have to use old data)
- add CBS extractor for historic Dutch power (and perhaps other) data
- Ireland scraper not downloading properly (when adding Ireland back be sure to add the the daily_demand and monthly_demand
analyzer files for industry_power calculations). Scraper downloads to *IE_flows_downloaded.csv* while extractor is trying to read from *src/data/raw/IE_flows.csv*
Seems to be an issue that we cannot cleanly download the data from the website - we receive empty dataframes often.

The clean_data_files for plotting are the two below:
- src/data/analyzed/daily_demand_clean.csv
- src/data/analyzed/monthly_demand_clean.csv

TO-CREATE, calculating weekofyear 1-52 and years from the daily_demand.csv

Pre-processing script
- weekly sums
- monthly index
- calculate European sums 

European averages (sum of countries). 

Fig1 - Weekly Gas demand
current python script is *weekly.py* 
- pre-processing, generating weekly sums from daily data. 
y-lines are 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2019-21 AVG
x is weekofyear
highcharts filter component (like EV deployment) where use can select from any (country, type) options. 
eg (Europe, Total) or (France, Industry)

Fig2 - Indexed monthly demand
current python script is called *monthly-index.py*
pre-processing, indexed monthly demand is calculated as monthly average from 2019-21. 
x-axis is months from Jan 19 to latest month. So we plot also 19-21 which should be around the 100 line. 
y-axis is the indexed value. 
highcharts filer component (exactly like EV deployment) where user can select any (country, type) options. 

Fig 3 - Monthly (or quarterly) stacked bar demand
src data = same as figure 2. 
start monthly, revent to quarterly if too noist
Filter the dataframe only for countries which have the decomposed data & caclulate aggregate European. 
[BE, FR, IT, DE, NL, ES, sum of these countries]
