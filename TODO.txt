- Ireland, we still wait for email feedback. 
    Ireland scraper not downloading properly (when adding Ireland back be sure to add the the daily_demand and monthly_demand
    analyzer files for industry_power calculations). Scraper downloads to *IE_flows_downloaded.csv* while extractor is trying to read from *src/data/raw/IE_flows.csv*
    Seems to be an issue that we cannot cleanly download the data from the website - we receive empty dataframes often.

- Denmark, numbers are slightly off Eurostat. Not sure how to properly process the JSON (include storage flows?)
